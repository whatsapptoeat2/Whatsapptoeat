9. Metrics analysis

An example Table of Content. Unfortunately, I do not have a good example 
for you to look at. Remember to :
- use screenshots to show what you did
- explain what the metric does
- explain how the metric is interpreted for your code
- explain what you could do to improve the code (but don't actually do it)


- Metrics Screenshot
-> McCabe
-> Number of Classes
 	

Give 1 point for each of these if present:

- Metrics Report is attached or linked (using use case template)
- There is an explanation provided with the handin that explains
 what the metrics mean.
- 2 metrics are explained in detail using numbers from their own code 
(explanation means that it shows that the number makes sense and the 
students can give examples of "bad" or "good" code)
- evidence of tool used is present with a screenshot in the document
- one extra point for very impressive documentation

Last two points show the following:
You will not be graded on having "good metrics" but on understanding how 
you can use metrics to improve your code and how to use an automatic tool
 to get to the information efficiently!
